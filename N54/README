IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ!

If you are using an app prior to v3.00 to flash, then you must use the _LEGACY.xdf for your ROM version.  These will eventually be deprecated and removed.

For custom tunes utilizing any MHD+ feature (or app v3.00 or higher), you must use the newly updated main XDFs.  Any tables from the _LEGACY xdf that are not in the new main XDFs were intentionally removed, and their CAL space is now use for something else.
